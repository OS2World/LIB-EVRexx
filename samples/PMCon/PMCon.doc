PMCon - EVRexx sample program.
-------------------------------

All output written to stdout/stderr by true PM-programs is usally lost -
unless you redirect this output to some files or to other programs.  The
idea of PMCon is to redirect this output to a REXX-queue, read the queue
and write the output to a MLE-window.  This window will act as a
console. Of course, PMCon can be used with any program, but it is
especially useful for PM-programs.

PMCon is driven by various commands. Programs are startet with (case is
irrelevant exept for options and of course program arguments):

     PMCon START [-np] program [program arguments]

This call will create the REXX-queue PMCON and the MLE, start the
program, pipe the results to the RXQUEUE-program (part of OS/2, acting
as an interface to the REXX-queue) and read the queue until PMCon is
stopped from outside (see below).

If the queue PMCon already exists, only the program is started. In this
case, PMCon stops afterwards, since the original copy will already
collect the output.

The meaning of the options is explained in the command overview below.

-------------------------------

As an example, try:
   start pcmon start dir  -> pipes output from dir to newly created window.
   pmcon edit             -> switch to edit mode (enables basic cut and paste).
   pmcon save             -> saves output to a file (after a a dialog).
   pmcon start pstat      -> adds new output to the window.
   pmcon stop -a          -> stop after presenting a dialog to append text.


-------------------------------

The operation of the console is driven by various commands. They can be
issued using PMCon, or directly from the program. For example

   PMCon STOP -s PMCON results.dat

from the commandline is equivalent to

   printf("+++STOP -s results.dat\n");

from within the program. In the later case no queuename is necessary,
since the output is automatically piped to the correct queue.


-------------------------------

Overwiew of commands (the escape sequence '+++' must be used from within
programs):

PMCon START [-np] program [program arguments]
   Starts the program and routes the output to a REXX-queue
   -n: start the program in a new session
   -p: use a private queue (default: PMCon)

PMCon STOP [-sa] [queuename [filename]]
+++STOP [-sa] [filename]
   Close the REXX-queue (PMCon if no queue name is given)
   -s: save output to filename (save-dialog if filename is omitted)
   -a: append output to filename (file-dialog if filename is omitted)

PMCon CLEAR [queuename]
+++CLEAR
   Clear the output window associated with queuename (def: PMCon)

PMCon EDIT [queuename]
+++EDIT
   Remove readonly attribute from the output window

PMCon NOEDIT [queuename]
+++NOEDIT
   Set readonly attribute for the output window

PMCon SAVE [queuename [filename]]
+++SAVE [filename]
   Save output to filename (save-dialog if filename is omitted)

PMCon APPEND [queuename [filename]]
+++APPEND [filename]
   Append output to filename (file-dialog if filename is omitted)
